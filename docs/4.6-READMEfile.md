# README file

The purpose of a README file is to give an overview of the content, aiding individuals in making sense of the data enclosed thereby persevering the long term value of the data. This can be very helpful if you are sharing your data with others, or to keep track of content and edits or changes made in multiple projects, or revisiting data after some time has passed. 

- A README file is better suited for a collection of data such as a directory for a specific project or experiment, software tool, or any data that is related to each other “logically”. 
- Place the README file in a parent directory associated with the content described. 
- Use plain markdown or a simple text editor to create the README file in either .md or .txt file format
- For dates use the  ISO 8601  standard: YYYY-MM-DD
- Whenever possible use the standard vocabulary from your field, see metadata standards directory by RDA community
