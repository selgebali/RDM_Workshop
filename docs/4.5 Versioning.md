# Versioning:
In order to keep track of changes made to a file/dataset, versioning can be an efficient way to see who did what and when, in collaborative work this can be very useful. 

A version control strategy will allow you to easily detect the most current/final version,  organize, manage and record any edits made while working on the document/data, drafting, editing and analysis. 

### Consider the following practices:
- Outline the master file and identify major files for instance; original, pre-review, 1st revision, 2nd revision, final revision, submitted. 
- Outline strategy for archiving and storing: Where to store the minor and major versions, how long will you retain them accordingly. 
- Maintain a record of file locations, a good place is in the README files
- Record any related files and documents and any updates/changes made to them
- Use systemic and unique naming system to identify the different versions, e.g. numbers and/or dates 
- Include a version control table that outlines the file history, which version, where the other versions are located, list all associated files and their versions and modifications, add dates, authors, access rights, licensing and details of changes made since last version
