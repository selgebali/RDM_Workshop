# Research Data Management Workshops

This is a collection for materials for Research Data Management workshops created by Sara El-Gebali and Özlem Özkan


> ### Our vision is to support researchers through all phases of research data life cycle (Planning, Data collection, Management and Analysis, Preservation and Sharing), in order to achieve a more effective use of resources, transparency, re-use, participation, accountability and reproducibility in the MDC as well as facilitate collaborative work across institutions.
