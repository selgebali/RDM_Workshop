# Data Reuse
Why is it important?
- Making the data available, does not ensure it is fit for reuse
- Reproducibility crisis
> "More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments." [1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)
- Preventing financial loss due to the inability to reuse data.
> " A 2018 European Commission report estimates that problems with the reuse of data cost the EU at least â‚¬10 billion each year in the academic sector alone"  [It is irresponsible to support research but not data stewardship](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00505-7)
