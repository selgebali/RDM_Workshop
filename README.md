# Research Data Management workshop material
Hi and Welcome to our collection. 

We created this material with the aim of designing a 3 hour workshop for new-comers to familiarise themselves with Research data management ins and outs. 
It is designed to be delivered in 3 parts. Under What is Research Data >> Session Structure you will find a template that will give you an idea on how to design this session. 
Feel free to let us know what works and what doesn't work, and let us know if you found it helpful.

### Enjoy!
